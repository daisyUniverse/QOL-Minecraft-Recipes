# Quality of Life Minecraft Recipes

This is a Datapack of all of the custom recipes I've made for my minecraft server, specifically designed not to be cheaty, just convenient. Go to the Releases tab to download the latest zip file.

### Main ones

- Logs to sticks

  put two logs in a stack and they will make 16 sticks, skipping having to make planks first

- Logs to Chests

  Make a chest out of logs to make 8 chests at once

- Slabs to Blocks

  Allows you to convert any two slabs back into a full block, just stack them.

This is made for 1.16+, and I plan on adding more as I come up with them
