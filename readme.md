# Quality of Life Minecraft Recipes

This is a Datapack of all of the custom recipes I've made for my minecraft server, specifically designed not to be cheaty, just convenient. Go to the Releases tab to download the latest zip file.

### Main ones

- Logs to Sticks

  put two logs in a stack and they will make 16 sticks, skipping having to make planks first

  

- Logs to Chests

  Make a chest out of logs to make 4 chests at once

  

- Logs to Torches

  Make a torch out of a log and a coal block to make 32 torches


- Veganish Books
  Make a book with Rotten Flesh instead of Leather so you don't have to kill cows
  

- Slabs to Blocks

  Allows you to convert any two slabs back into a full block, just stack them.

  

- Stairs to Blocks

  Allows you to convert Stairs back into full blocks

  

- Glass Panes to Glass Blocks

  Return to monke

  

  

This is made for 1.16+, and I plan on adding more as I come up with them
